# OOP Four Main Pillar 

## 1. Abstraction
<p>Abstraction means hiding the implementation details inside and providing just necessary API. We never know how it is working,
we only know what to do.</p>

## 2. Encapsulation 
<p>The definition of encapsulation is "the action of enclosing something in or as if a capsule". Encapsulation means that 
each object in your code should control its own state. State is the current "snapshot" of your object.</p>

 ## 3. Inheritance 
 <p>The ability of creating a new class from an existing class. Inheritance is when an object acquires the property of another object. Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and behavior of another class.</p>

 ## 4. Polymorphism
 <p>Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means "many forms"</p>

# 🏛️ OOP Four Main Pillars 🏛️

## 1. 🎩 Abstraction - The Magic of Simplicity 🧙‍♂️
<p>Abstraction is like a magic trick that simplifies complex things. It's like using a black box—no need to know how it works, just use it! It hides the complicated details and provides a straightforward interface. Imagine a magician's hat that holds surprises, where you only need to know the right move to reveal the magic.</p>

## 2. 📦 Encapsulation - The Organization Master 🧰 
<p>Encapsulation is all about staying organized, like having separate compartments in a toolbox. Each object keeps its secrets safe. It's like a protective capsule that contains everything related to an object—its data, methods, and mysteries—shielded from prying eyes. Think of it as a tidy storage space for objects, ensuring they mind their own business and maintain order.</p>

 ## 3. 🧬 Inheritance - The Family Legacy 🌳 
 <p>Inheritance is like a family tree passing down traits through generations. It's as if one object inherits the qualities of another, becoming a close relative with added abilities. It allows you to create new classes that inherit the greatness of their parent classes. Imagine a family reunion where everyone shares a common heritage but brings their own unique talents to the table.</p>

 ## 4. 🎭 Polymorphism - The Shape-Shifting Wizard 🦎
 <p>Polymorphism is the shape-shifter of programming—adapting to different forms like a skilled performer on stage. It's the art of flexibility, enabling objects to change behavior as needed. It's like having a versatile actor in your code, seamlessly transitioning between roles. Picture a performer who effortlessly switches characters, making you wonder if it's the same person or an entirely new entity.</p>
