## 1. Abstraction
<p>Abstraction means hiding the implementation details inside and providing just necessary API. We never know how it is working,
we only know what to do.</p>

## 2. Encapsulation 
<p>The definition of encapsulation is "the action of enclosing something in or as if a capsule". Encapsulation means that 
each object in your code should control its own state. State is the current "snapshot" of your object.</p>
